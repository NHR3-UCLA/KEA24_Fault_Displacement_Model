# KEA24 Fault Displacement Model

The model is documented in:
> Kuehn NM, Kottke AR, Sarmiento AC, Madugo CM and Bozorgnia Y (2024). A fault displacement model based on the FDHI database: *Earthquake Spectra*, Epub ahead of print, DOI: 10.1177/ToBeAssigned.

The `data` directory contains full model coefficients, point estimates for the model coefficients, and standard deviations of the epistemic uncertainty for a set of predetermined scenarios.

A Python package implementing the model can be installed as described in the [documentation](https://kuehn-et-al-fdm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
